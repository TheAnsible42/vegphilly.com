django-vegancity
================

a vegan website for every city!  

the idea is simple.  instead of building a vegan website for our city, we're building a vegan website that can be implemented in any city.  

project notes
=============
for the moment, all development notes and bugs will exist in this file, until we outgrow it.  

all developers should (eventually) have the following untracked files in their working folder:  
django-vegancity/vegancity/settings_local.py   - this file will contain information about the development database we are using.  
django-vegancity/vegancity/db                  - this is the sqlite database file used, until we outgrow it.  

todo:
====
-Get some dummy data for Philadelphia into vegacity/script.py  
-work on search page (extensively)  
-set up user account models  
-set up user review system  
-Pretty much everything...
