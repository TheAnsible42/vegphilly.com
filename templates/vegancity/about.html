      <p>Vegancity helps answer the inevitable question: where are we going to eat?</p>

      <p>Vegancity was founded by several vegans in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania who wanted more detailed and accurate information about vegan and vegan-friendly establishments in their city. We want Vegancity to be the most comprehensive list of both vegan restaurants and places that offer vegan options. We hope to add forums, and a blog to highlight new vegan foods and places to eat.</p>

      <p>We need your help to make the site better. Please contact us if you have any comments, questions, or suggestions.</p>

      <p>
        Zack is a Brooklyn, NY-based graphic/web designer. While he's not designing or playing guitar with the NYC-based metal band Scowl, he can be found stuffing his face with vegan food (that's most assuredly covered in hot sauce) and riding his bike on the mean streets of New York City.
