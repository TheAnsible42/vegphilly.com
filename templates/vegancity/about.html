    <div class="about-summary row">
      <div class="span4">
        <p>We founded VegPhilly because we wanted more detailed and accurate information about vegan and vegan-friendly establishments in our city. We want to create the most comprehensive list of vegan restaurants and places that offer vegan options, reviewed and rated.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="span4">
        <p>We need your help to make the site better. After creating an account, you can add new restaurants, write reviews, and even add your favorite vegan dishes. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:vegphilly@gmail.com">vegphilly@gmail.com</a> if you have any comments, questions, or suggestions.</p>

      <div class="span4">
        <p>VegPhilly is built with free and open source software. Our vision is to produce a framework for a vegan website that is easily deployable in any city. If you are interested in using our code to start a site in your city, contact us or check out our source code on <a href="http://github.com/steventlamb/django-vegancity" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

He initially envisioned VegPhilly after relocating from New York City, where he used similar resources to find vegan food. He loves <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">free software</a> and all things geek. You can usually find him with his nose in a science fiction book or eating at one of the awesome restaurants listed on this site. He puts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritional_yeast" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">nutritional yeast</a> on pretty much everything.</p></div>

When he's not designing or playing guitar with the New York-based metal band Scowl, he can be found stuffing his face with vegan food (that's most assuredly covered in hot sauce) and biking the mean streets of New York City.
