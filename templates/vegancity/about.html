      <h5>VegPhilly helps answer the inevitable question: where are we going to eat?</h5>

      <p>We founded VegPhilly becuase we wanted more detailed and accurate information about vegan and vegan-friendly establishments in our city. We hope to create the most comprehensive list of vegan restaurants and places that offer vegan options, reviewed and rated. We will also feature new vegan foods and places to eat.</p>
      <p>We need your help to make the site better. After creating an account, you can add new restaurants, write reviews, and even add your favorite vegan dishes. Please contact us at vegphilly@gmail.com if you have any comments, questions, or suggestions.</p>
<p>VegPhilly is built with free and open source software. Our vision is to produce a framework for a vegan website that is easily-deployable in any city. If you are interested in using our code to start a site in your city, contact us or check out our source code on <a href="https://github.com/steventlamb/django-vegancity" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

      <p>Design Lead</p>
      <p>
        Zack is a Brooklyn-based graphic and web designer. When he's not designing or playing guitar with the New York-based metal band Scowl, he can be found stuffing his face with vegan food (that's most assuredly covered in hot sauce) and biking the mean streets of New York City.
