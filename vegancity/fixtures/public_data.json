Their prices are awesome, the wait staff is really nice, and the food is really great. I have it a 3/4 because it is not fancy gourmet dining but for vegan food it's amazing. The dim sum is a great value for 2 people or more and lets you get a really good feel for the place. They also have a pretty decent all you can eat buffet on Sunday evenings...well worth the trip! The restaurant itself is a little outdated and could us a new carpet/fresh coat of paint so it may not be the best place for a super fancy first date. However, it is cozy and clean. I would recommend this place 100 times over because of the wide selection, the tastiness of the food, and the ease of having a full vegan menu so you don't have to wonder what you can or can't eat."}},
