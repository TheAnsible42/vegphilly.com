Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How does Veg Philly determine the vegan-ness of restaurants?

A: We talk to waiters and chefs at restaurants to determine their level of vegan-ness. All information is accurate to the best of our knowledge, but cooking practices at restaurants can change. Even at vegan-friendly restaurants the same cookware or fryers may be used for meat or dairy. Please contact us if you have any questions.
