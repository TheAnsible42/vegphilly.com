About Vegancity

Vegancity helps answer the inevitable question: where are we going to eat? 

Vegancity was founded by several vegans in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania who wanted more detailed and accurate information about vegan and vegan-friendly establishments on one website. We want Vegancity to be the most comprehensive list of both vegan restaurants and restaurants that offer vegan options. We hope to add forums, and a blog to highlight new vegan foods and places to eat. 

We need your help to make the site better. Please contact us if you have any comments, questions, or suggestions.
